Dear N/A-NAME N/A_SURNAME,

I am writing to introduce myself as a student of Silesian University of Technology. I am responding to your advertisement on pracuj.pl website.
To be more precise I am talking about the Java Programmer position.

As you can see in my Curriculum Vitae I have already worked as a working student in Nokia, Wroclaw. I started right after I completed the 
Nokia Academy training course. I had to quit for my personal reasons (including my university stuff).  

Right now I'm close to completion of handling those things therefore I'm ready to be hired in a few days. I treat my current situation as an 
opportunity for changing my career path so I would preffer to try myself at programming in java instead of C++, especially in your company. 
As you can see, my coding style is still terrible. That's why I want to join you so we could make it far far better, together ;)..
I'm sure than in short time I can become a very valuable employee for you. I just need a mentor to show me the way ;).


Best regards,
Daniel Janocha
